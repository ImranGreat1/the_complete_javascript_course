In the previous chapters we've been discussing Javascript,
the core language but he haven't actually make it interact
with a webpage, we only log output to the console.
In this chapter we will make Javascript interact with a
webpage which technically known as doing DOM Manipulation.

What is the DOM ?
The DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM is a
structured representation of an HTML document that can be
use to connect webpages to script or programming languages
such as Javascript.
We can assume that every HTML tag in the DOM to be like a box
The DOM object is a fully object-oriented representaion which means
everything in the DOM can be accessed as an object. For example a
body tag can be accessed as an object in the DOM.
The DOM also has it object which is the document object which gives
us access to the webpage because the webpage is stored in the DOM.

The ability for us to be able to access and manipulate the DOM
is called DOM MANIPULATION.
